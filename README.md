# Cloud Native Spring in Action

<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-spring-in-action?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&a_aid=thomas&a_bid=3dda43a8"><img src="/book-cover.jpeg" alt="The book cover of 'Cloud Native Spring in Action' by Thomas Vitale" align="left" height="200px" /></a>

This repository contains the source code accompanying the book [Cloud Native Spring in Action - With Spring Boot and Kubernetes](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-spring-in-action?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&a_aid=thomas&a_bid=3dda43a8) written by [Thomas Vitale](https://www.thomasvitale.com/) and published by Manning Publications. It's currently available through the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP).

There is a folder for each chapter, for which both an _initial_ and _final_ versions are available. For example, for chapter 4, you can use `Chapter04/04-begin` as a starting point to follow along with the examples in the chapter and `Chapter04/04-end` to check the code as it looks like at the end.

## Prerequisites

Chapter after chapter, you'll build, containerize, and deploy cloud native applications. Along the journey, you will need the following software installed.

* Java 11+ or later
    * [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net)
    * [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io)
* Docker 20.03+
    * [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
    * [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    * [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* Kubernetes 1.19+
    * [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
    * [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)
* Other
    * [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/)

## Gradle and Maven

The code samples in the book use Gradle as the build tool. Should you prefer Maven, here's a table mapping Gradle commands to Maven so that you can easily follow along.

Gradle | Maven
------ | ------
`./gradlew clean` | `./mvnw clean`
`./gradlew build` | `./mvnw install`
`./gradlew test` | `./mvnw test`
`./gradlew bootJar` | `./mvnw repackage`
`./gradlew bootRun` | `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
`./gradlew bootBuildImage` | `./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`
