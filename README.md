# üçÉ Cloud Native Spring in Action

This repository contains the source code accompanying the book [Cloud Native Spring in Action - With Spring Boot and Kubernetes](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-spring-in-action) written by [Thomas Vitale](https://www.thomasvitale.com/) and published by Manning Publications.

There is a folder for each chapter, for which both an _initial_ and _final_ versions are available. For example, for chapter 4, you can use `Chapter04/04-begin` as a starting point to follow along with the examples in the chapter and `Chapter04/04-end` to check the code as it looks like at the end.

The book uses Spring Boot 2.7 and this main branch contains the samples updated to version 2.7.18. You can find the same examples upgraded to the latest [3.x](https://github.com/ThomasVitale/cloud-native-spring-in-action/tree/sb-3-main) version of Spring Boot in a dedicated branche. Feel free to use **Spring Boot 3** while reading the book. Only a few minor changes are necessary to the code samples and they are documented [here](https://github.com/ThomasVitale/cloud-native-spring-in-action/blob/sb-3-main/README.md).

## Prerequisites

Chapter after chapter, you'll build, containerize, and deploy cloud native applications. Along the journey, you will need the following software installed.

* Java 17+
    * OpenJDK: [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net)
    * GraalVM: [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org)
    * JDK Management: [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io)
* Docker 24+
    * [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
    * [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    * [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* Kubernetes 1.27+
    * [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
    * [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
* Other
    * [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/)

## Gradle and Maven

The code samples in the book use Gradle as the build tool. Should you prefer Maven, here's a table mapping Gradle commands to Maven so that you can easily follow along.

Gradle | Maven
------ | ------
`./gradlew clean` | `./mvnw clean`
`./gradlew build` | `./mvnw install`
`./gradlew test` | `./mvnw test`
`./gradlew bootJar` | `./mvnw spring-boot:repackage`
`./gradlew bootRun` | `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
`./gradlew bootBuildImage` | `./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`
