# Chapter 16 - Begin

In this chapter, you'll build Quote Service and Quote Function applications. You can initialize a Spring Boot project using your
favorite method. This guide describes how to do that with the Spring Initializr application and with its REST API.
Either way, you'll get a zip archive that you can extract and import in your IDE.
