# Configuring Visual Studio Code

This guide describes how to set up Visual Studio Code for working with Java, Spring Boot and Kubernetes.

## Java and Spring Boot extensions

To work with Java and Spring Boot in Visual Studio Code, the following extensions are recommended:

* [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
* [Spring Boot Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack)

## Kubernetes extension

When working with Kubernetes manifests, you can install a dedicated extension to help you validate the syntax and identifying mistakes.

Check the [extension documentation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) for instructions on how to install it.
